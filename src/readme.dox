This library provides basic functions to initialize the ST7735 Controller and draw text, lines and circles and text fields on the display.
Communication between the Raspberry Pi and the ST7735 is managed by the wiringPi library.

The library is based on the tft_st7735 library by Juergen Schick (jschick).
